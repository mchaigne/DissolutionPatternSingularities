The files "StMarcelCaveXYZ1.txt" to "StMarcelCaveXYZ4.txt" are point clouds corresponding to the 3D reconstruction of a wall of the Saint-Marcel cave by photogrammetry.
These four files were separated only because the file is two heavy to be stored in GitHub, but should be recombined into one single file. 
They all have three columns, each giving one coordinate: 1st coumn gives x coordinate (horizontal), 2nd column gives y coordinate (vertical), 3rd coumn gives z coordinate (transversal).
